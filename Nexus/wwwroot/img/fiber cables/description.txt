Cable 1: 
Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):

Description: Single-mode fiber is designed for long-distance, high-bandwidth applications where signal integrity is critical. It allows a single mode of light to propagate through the fiber core.

Specifications:
Core Diameter: Typically 9 micrometers
Cladding Diameter: Around 125 micrometers
Mode of Propagation: Single mode
Bandwidth: Up to 100 Gbps and beyond
Distance: Up to tens of kilometers

Cable 2:
Multimode Fiber (MMF):

Description: Multimode fiber is suitable for shorter-distance applications, such as local area networks (LANs) and data centers. It supports multiple modes of light propagation through the fiber core.

Specifications:
Core Diameter: Typically 50 or 62.5 micrometers
Cladding Diameter: Around 125 micrometers
Mode of Propagation: Multiple modes
Bandwidth: Up to 100 Gbps over short distances
Distance: Up to several hundred meters to a few kilometers

Cable 3:
Plastic Optical Fiber (POF):

Description: POF is made from plastic materials and is often used in applications requiring flexibility and cost-effectiveness, such as home networking and automotive communications.

Specifications:
Core Diameter: Typically around 1 millimeter
Cladding Diameter: Varies
Mode of Propagation: Single mode or multimode
Bandwidth: Up to 1 Gbps or more
Distance: Up to several hundred meters

Cable 4:

Active Optical Cable (AOC):

Description: AOC integrates optoelectronic components directly into the cable assembly, providing high-speed data transmission over short to medium distances.

Specifications:
Data Rate: Typically up to 100 Gbps or higher
Connector Types: Various, including SFP, QSFP, and CXP
Length: Typically up to tens of meters
Power Consumption: Varies depending on the cable length and data rate
Applications: Data centers, high-performance computing, storage area networks

Cable 5:

Ribbon Fiber:

Description: Ribbon fiber cables consist of multiple fiber strands arranged in a flat ribbon-like structure, offering high fiber density and easier mass fusion splicing.

Specifications:
Fiber Count: Typically 8, 12, 24, or 48 fibers per ribbon
Ribbon Width: Varies depending on the fiber count
Jacket Type: Usually tight-buffered for protection
Applications: Backbone networks, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), high-density data centers
Advantages: High fiber density, easy splicing, space-saving design
